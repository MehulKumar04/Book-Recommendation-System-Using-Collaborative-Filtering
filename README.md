# 📚 Book Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering

This project is a **Book Recommendation System** that suggests books to users based on their reading history and preferences using **Collaborative Filtering**. It analyzes user-book interactions and identifies patterns to recommend books that similar users have enjoyed.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Collaborative Filtering is a popular recommendation technique that works by finding **similar users or items** based on their behavior (like ratings or preferences).  
Unlike content-based systems, it doesn’t rely on item features but rather on **user-item relationships**.  

This system uses **User-Based** or **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** with **Cosine Similarity** to generate personalized recommendations.
